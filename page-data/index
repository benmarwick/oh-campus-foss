<p>Hi. We're <a href="http://openhatch.org">OpenHatch</a>. We're a bunch of open
source software enthusiasts.</p>

<p>We're currently organizing weekend workshops at colleges to teach students how to get
involved in open source software. You can invite us to your college.</p>

<p>We want more college students to have the community knowledge and technical
skills to participate in globally distributed software projects: big ones, like
<a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a> and <a
href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>, and smaller ones, like <a
href="http://mediagoblin.org/">GNU MediaGoblin</a> and <a
href="http://rephial.org/">angband</a>.</p>

<p>You do <b>not</b> need to know how to program to contribute to open source
software. Open source projects need code, but they also need original art,
testing, documentation, web design, bug triaging, and more.</p>

<p>Does that sound cool? We'll teach you. <a href="upcoming-events/">See if
we're coming to your school soon</a>—if not, <a
href="upcoming-events/">contact us</a> to see if we can work together to run a
workshop on your campus!</p>
