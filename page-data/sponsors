<h2>Become a sponsor</h2>

<p>With your support, we can teach open source participation and
collaboration skills to hundreds or thousands of students.</p>

<p>Our goal is to bring local open source
community members to campuses world-wide, bridging the two
communities and making both stronger. By focusing on building
local community, we keep costs low while also increasing the
chance of sustained involvement on both sides.</p>

<p>Your sponsorship would go toward event expenses like refreshments
and travel for the event organizer. We are also seeking ongoing
sponsors willing to fund curriculum development. You can support
open source in your community, now and in the years to come, by donating.</p>

<p>If you are interested in sponsoring, by donating
funds or in kind, let us know at <a href="mailto:hello@openhatch.org">hello@openhatch.org</a>.
If you are part of an open source project and want to help
teach these events, send us email as well!</p>

<p>Open Source Comes to Campus is a project of OpenHatch, a
community open source project. Soon it will be a project of
Software in the Public Interest, a New York-based 501(c)3
non-profit.</p>
