<h2>Become a sponsor</h2>

<p>Do you represent a big free software project with contributors
around the globe? We would love to partner with you on getting those
people into classrooms and teaching university students.</p>

<p>Do you represent a company that uses open source heavily?
We want your help financing travel and other event expenses.
By sponsoring Open Source Comes to Campus, we will give your
brand more visibility and showcase your company's open source
connections to students who will soon be entering the workforce.
With your support, we can teach open source participation and
collaboration skills to hundreds or thousands of students.</p>

<p>Our goal is to bring local open source
community members to campuses world-wide, bridging the two
communities and making both stronger. By focusing on building
local community, we keep costs low while also increasing the
chance of sustained involvement on both sides.</p>

<p>We are seeking volunteers to join us in the classroom, as well asongoing
