<h2>What we teach</h2>

<p>A typical Open Source Comes to Campus event has two parts: the <strong>morning tutorials</strong>, where we teach you how to use the tools and lingo associated with open source software development, and a <strong>contributions workshop</strong> where you and your fellow students choose an open source software project to work on, find a bug to tackle, and (hopefully) write your first patch, make your first documentation fix, or otherwise make a contribution to open source software.</p>

<h3>The Tutorials</h3>

<p>Start off the day with coffee, donuts, and a series of hands-on activities teaching you:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Communication technologies</strong> like chat (IRC-based) and mailing lists</li>
<li><strong>Project organization</strong>, including version control, bug trackers, and individual roles within a project</li>
<li><strong>Command line skills</strong> so you know how to navigate Linux and similar systems</li>
<li><strong>The movement</strong>: where open source came from, and what makes it important</li>
</ul>

<p>Mentors familiar with open source will be there to help you if you get stuck, and to tell you about their experiences in the community.</p>

<h3>The Contributions Workshop</h3>

<p>Bring your laptop and work on an open source software project. You
can program, write documentation, meet other awesome open source
contributors through <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr>,
discover and report usability problems, and more.</p>

<p>We'll provided you with carefully selected first tasks from projects with friendly maintainers and well-documented code. Many projects will have maintainers available, in person or remotely, throughout the event. This is a perfect opportunity to work on your problem-solving 
skills, and learn to collaborate with other open source programmers.</p>
