<h2>What we teach</h2>

<p>A typical Open Source Comes to Campus event has two parts: a <strong>workshop</strong> where we teach you how to use the tools and lingo associated with open source software development, and a <strong>project day</strong> where you and your fellow students choose an open source software project to work on, find a bug to tackle, and (hopefully) write your first patch, make your first documentation fix, or otherwise make a contribution to open source software.</p>

<h3>The workshop</h3>

<p>We usually hold this on a Saturday. The 20 most excited students in your
college attend, and they work hands-on with open source community members to
learn:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Communication technologies</strong>, like chat (IRC-based) and mailing lists</li>
<li><strong>Project organization</strong>, including version control, bug trackers, and individual roles within a project</li>
<li><strong>Getting the code</strong>, and the basics you need to build most packages you'll find</li>
<li><strong>Command line skills</strong> so you know how to navigate Linux and similar systems</li>
<li><strong>The movement</strong>: Where open source came from, and what makes it important</li>
</ul>

<h3>The project day</h3>

<p>Bring your laptop and work on an open source software project.
You can program, write documentation,
make fun of people through <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr>,
discover and report usability problems, and more.</p>

<p>The point of this project day is to help you get your hands dirty working on a real project. To help with that,
we'll have Asheesh Laroia from <a href="http://openhatch.org/">OpenHatch</a>
and other community members in attendance. If you don't know what you want to work on,
or you get stuck, you can ask for help, ideas, or advice.</p>

<p>This is a perfect opportunity to work on your problem-solving 
skills, and learn to collaborate with other open source programmers.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<h3>Why do this?</h3>

<p>Open source software like Linux and Firefox are used by hundreds of millions of people.
This event is the jump start to participating.</p>

<p>If you come out on Saturday, we'll teach you how the community works. You'll get to play with
essential tools like version control and IRC chat.</p>

<h3>You want me to go to class on Saturday?</h3>

<p>It's not really <em>class</em>. For half an hour, five students and one teacher will discuss
a particular topic, like how projects collaborate using bug trackers. Then you get to
<strong>try things out</strong> on your own computer. Then onto the next topic.</p>

<p>Plus you will get lunch and other goodies like books and subscriptions.</p>
