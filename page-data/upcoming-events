<h2>How to bring us to your school</h2>

<p>We're looking for students to bring us to their universities and colleges. Can you help?</p>

<p><strong>Here's the short version</strong>: Send an email to hello@openhatch.org with the following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your name and your college's name</li>
<li>One sentence about how you discovered this website</li>
<li>One sentence about your involvement in open source (e.g., "never heard of it", "run Ubuntu", "wrote most of the Linux kernel")</li>
<li>One sentence about why you're excited about hosting this event</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Here's some more background</strong>:
We aim to have 20-30 students attend each OpenHatch workshop. We're
especially hoping to hear from you if your school has least 150
students in computer science, software engineering, or other similar
engineering disciplines. (If you're not sure, it's okay: send us an email anyway.)</p>

<p>If your school isn't in the Boston area, it's very helpful if you can talk to
your computer science department about organizing travel funding for Asheesh,
the main organizer. We can often help you ask for this.</p>

<p>Once you get in touch with us, we'll work on choosing a
date. With your help, we can schedule
the event so that it works best for students at your college.
OpenHatch will work to find good teachers from the open source community
near your college. (If you have ideas for people, do say so!)</p>
