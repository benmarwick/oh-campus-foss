<h2>Upcoming events</h2>

<p>We're currently planning events for winter/spring 2014.  Contact us if you're interested.</p>

<h2>How to bring us to your school</h2>

<p>We're looking for students to bring us to their universities and colleges. Can you help?</p>

<p><strong>Here's the short version</strong>: Send an email to <a
href="mailto:hello@openhatch.org">hello@openhatch.org</a> with the
following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your name and your college's name</li>
<li>One sentence about how you discovered this website</li>
<li>One sentence about your involvement in open source (e.g., "never heard of it", "run Ubuntu", "wrote most of the Linux kernel")</li>
<li>One sentence about why you're excited about hosting this event</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you get in touch with us, you'll hear back from us within a few days. 
We'll work together to choose a date. With your help, we can schedule the event
so that it works best for students at your college.</p>

<p>Once we've picked a location and date, we'll help you with the rest of the planning:
finding sponsors for the event, recruiting experienced mentors to help teach, publicizing
the event, and more.</p>
