<h2>How to bring us to your school</h2>

<p>We're looking for students to bring us to their universities and colleges. Can you help?</p>

<p><strong>Here's the short version</strong>: Send an email to <a
href="mailto:hello@openhatch.org">hello@openhatch.org</a> with the
following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your name and your college's name</li>
<li>One sentence about how you discovered this website</li>
<li>One sentence about your involvement in open source (e.g., "never heard of it", "run Ubuntu", "wrote most of the Linux kernel")</li>
<li>One sentence about why you're excited about hosting this event</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Here's some more background</strong>:
We aim to have 20-30 students attend each OpenHatch workshop. We're
especially hoping to hear from you if your school has least 150
students in computer science, software engineering, or other similar
engineering disciplines. (If you're not sure, it's okay. Send us an email anyway.)</p>

<p>Once you get in touch with us, we'll work on choosing a date. With
your help, we can schedule the event so that it works best for
students at your college. OpenHatch will bring Asheesh, the project
lead, and other open source community members to teach. (If there are
professors or local open source community members you want to be a
part of this, let us know!)</p>
