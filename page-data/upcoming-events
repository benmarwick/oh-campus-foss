<h2>Upcoming events</h2>

<p>We have an upcoming <a href="http://princeton.openhatch.org">event at Princeton University</a> on November 24th, 2013.  Contact us if you want to get involved!</p>

<p>We're currently planning events for winter/spring 2014.  Contact us if you're interested.</p>

<h2>How to bring us to your school</h2>

<p>We're looking for students to bring us to their universities and colleges. Can you help?</p>

<p><strong>Here's the short version</strong>: Send an email to <a
href="mailto:hello@openhatch.org">hello@openhatch.org</a> with the
following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your name and your college's name</li>
<li>One sentence about how you discovered this website</li>
<li>One sentence about your involvement in open source (e.g., "never heard of it", "run Ubuntu", "wrote most of the Linux kernel")</li>
<li>One sentence about why you're excited about hosting this event</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Here's some more background</strong>: We aim to have 20-30 
students attend each OpenHatch workshop. We're especially hoping to 
hear from universities with active programming-related student groups 
(like <abbr title="Association for Computing Machinery chapters">ACM</abbr>
or <abbr title="Society of Women Engineers">SWE</abbr>) or a large number
of programming students (around 150, or even more!). We also want to hear
from you if you're excited about the program, no matter what your university
is like. Send us an email!</p>

<p>Once you get in touch with us, you'll hear back from Asheesh Laroia,
the project lead. We'll work together to choose a date. With
your help, we can schedule the event so that it works best for
students at your college. We can also talk about finding sponsors to
make the event an even bigger success.</p>

<p>OpenHatch will work to find experienced people near your campus who 
can help teach. A representative of OpenHatch (read more <a href="/about/">about us</a>)
will plan and organize the event. (If there are professors or local 
open source community members you want to be a part of this, say so in
your email!)</p>
